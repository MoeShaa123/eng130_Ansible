## What is Infrastructure as Code

- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the managing and provisioning of infrastructure through code instead of through manual processes.

- With IaC, configuration files are created that contain your infrastructure specifications, which makes it easier to edit and distribute configurations.

- Orchestration means arranging or coordinating multiple systems. It’s also used to mean “running the same tasks on a bunch of servers at once

- Automating infrastructure provisioning with IaC means that developers don’t need to manually provision and manage servers, operating systems, storage, and other infrastructure components each time they develop or deploy an application.

## What is Ansible

- Ansible is the simplest way to automate apps and IT infrastructure.

- It uses YAML which is simple and easy to learn.

- In Ansible, there are two categories of computers: the control node and managed nodes. The control node is a computer that runs Ansible.

- Ansible is agentless, which means the nodes it manages do not require any software to be installed on them.
